# 👋 Hello

I am a Assitant Professor at Wuhan University of Technology, focusing on Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) of Marine Power Systems.

I am particularly interested in:

- 🔍 Anomaly Detection and Fault Diagnosis  
- ⚙️ Fault Tolerance and Perception System Reliability  
- 🧠 Multi-modal Condition Representation and RUL Prediction  
- 🌐 Digital Twin & Dynamic Modeling for Mechanical Systems
